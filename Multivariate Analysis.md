The multivariate analysis problems discussed here are like problems in regression or linear models, except that a single analysis includes two or more dependent variables.

## Method

1. Discriminant Analysis 

  * The purpose of discriminant analysis is to correctly classify observations or people into homogeneous groups.
  * The overall fit is assessed by looking at the degree to which the group means differ (Wilkes Lambda or D2) and how well the model classifies. To determine which variables have the most impact on the discriminant function, it is possible to look at partial F values. The higher the partial F, the more impact that variable has on the discriminant function.

2. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) 

  * This technique examines the relationship between several **categorical independent variables** and two or more **metric dependent variables**.
  *  Whereas analysis of variance (ANOVA) assesses the differences between groups (by using T tests for two means and F tests between three or more means), MANOVA examines the dependence relationship between a set of dependent measures across a set of groups.
  *   If there is a significant difference in the means, the null hypothesis can be rejected and treatment differences can be determined.

3. Factor Analysis 

When there are many variables in a research design, it is often helpful to reduce the variables to a smaller set of factors.(Only works on independent variable)

Two Factor Analysis methods:

  * Common Factor Analysis, which extracts factors based on the variance shared by the factors
  * Principal Component Analysis, which extracts factors based on the total variance of the factors. 
    *  is used to find the fewest number of variables that explain the most variance. The first factor extracted explains the most variance. 

4. Canonical Correlation

The most flexible of the multivariate techniques, canonical correlation simultaneously correlates several independent variables and several dependent variables. This powerful technique utilizes metric independent variables, unlike MANOVA, such as sales, satisfaction levels, and usage levels. It can also utilize nonmetric categorical variables.
